In 2009, the White House kicked off the [Open Government Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive), which included a norm  of creating _agency.gov/open_ hubs.  This page is a first pass at what might go on a 18f.gsa.gov/open.  

18F is committed to working in the open.  Be sure to check out these resources in order to know what 18F is up to:
